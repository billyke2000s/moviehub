# Changelog

Versions are published to TVs through the in-app updater (`android-tv-latest` release). Each
version below was built from the listed `main` commit. Earlier history is in the git log.

## Unreleased

On `main` but not yet published to TVs:

- Full portrait posters and redesigned movie/series browsing with filter overlays (PR #20).
- The catalogue no longer jumps back to the top when the first page arrives; long category lists
  moved into a Browse overlay (PR #21, plus direct follow-up commits on initial poster focus).
- Rearrange the Home hotbar with the remote; app actions and Android system controls in All Apps (PR #23).
- Redesigned streaming menus: catalogue previews, cinematic details, trailers, cast, collections,
  search history, combined filters, library sorting, viewing progress, watched episodes, channel
  groups and logos, source quality filters, cloud breadcrumbs and player options (PR #24).
- Fixed: quick D-pad presses along a poster row or grid could lose the selection.
- Failures the app recovers from are logged to logcat (tag `MovieHub`) without account details.
- Device tests are reliable again (8/8 parallel runs) and call app code directly; CI actions use Node 24.
- MovieHub Start: an optional companion Home app that reopens MovieHub after updates, waits while
  MovieHub is updating, and falls back to the stock launcher if MovieHub crashes 3 times within
  3 minutes. MovieHub reports crashes to it.
- Code restructure: Java sources reformatted for readability, `MainActivity` split into feature
  classes, project documentation added, and failed device tests listed as CI annotations. No
  intended behaviour change (PR #25).
